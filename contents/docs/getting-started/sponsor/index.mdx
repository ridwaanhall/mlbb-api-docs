description: Support the MLBB API Stats project by becoming a sponsor.

The MLBB API Stats project is a free resource for the community, but it requires ongoing financial support to stay online. To cover server hosting and maintenance costs, we need to raise at least $50 USD per month. Your sponsorship would be incredibly helpful in keeping this project alive and allowing for future development. Please consider becoming a sponsor to help us continue providing this service.
