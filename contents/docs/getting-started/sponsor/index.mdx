description: Support the MLBB API Stats project by becoming a sponsor.
---

The MLBB API Stats project is a free resource for the community, but it requires ongoing financial support to stay online. Your sponsorship would be incredibly helpful in keeping this project alive and allowing for future development. Please consider becoming a sponsor to help us continue providing this service.

<Note title="Info" type="danger">
  Since there are no sponsors/donations coming in (at least $50 USD/month) and due to the high level of API usage, a hosting upgrade is required to handle more requests. Without the necessary funding, the API for the Mobile Legends game will be discontinued on July 10, 2025.
